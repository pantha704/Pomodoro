# Pomodoro
Boost your productivity with this timer based on Pomodoro Technique !

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Francesco Cirillo used as a university student.

The technique has four steps:

- Choose a task.
- Set a timer for 25 minutes.
- Work on the task until the timer goes off.
- Take a short break.
- After four pomodoros, take a longer break.

The Pomodoro Technique is a simple but effective way to improve focus and productivity. It can be used for any task, large or small.
